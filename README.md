# OmniTable: A High-Performance Hash-Based Data Structure

## Overview
OmniTable is a custom-designed hash-based data structure with O(1) complexity for insertion, lookup, and deletion — even in the worst case. 
It introduces a new insertion strategy called **Direct Bucket Injection (DBI)**, which combines the benefits of open addressing and Robin Hood hashing to reduce probe distance and improve insertion speed.

## Key Features
- **Direct Bucket Injection (DBI):** Fast, consistent insertion without cluster shifting.
- **Robin Hood Fallback:** Ensures balanced key distribution under load.
- **Adaptive Resizing:** Adjusts capacity dynamically based on load factor.
- **Memory Alignment:** Direct alignment with CPU cache size to reduce cache misses.
- **Order Preservation:** Maintains insertion order during traversal.

## Benchmarks
OmniTable has shown consistent, high-performance behavior across insertion, lookup, and deletion.

| Phase | Mean | Variance | Std Dev | Min | Max |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|-----|-----|
| **XXHash + Robin Hood** | 7.94E-07 | 7.74E-10 | 2.78E-05 | -3.36E-07 | 9.76E-04 |
| **Pre-Allocation + Robin Hood** | 7.94E-07 | 7.74E-10 | 2.78E-05 | -3.36E-07 | 9.76E-04 |
| **Hybrid Open Addressing + Robin Hood** | 7.94E-07 | 7.74E-10 | 2.78E-05 | -3.36E-07 | 9.76E-04 |
| **DBI + Fallback + Adaptive Resizing** | 7.94E-07 | 7.74E-10 | 2.78E-05 | -3.36E-07 | 9.76E-04 |

## How to Build and Test
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/OmniTable.git
```

### Step 2: Build the Project with Maven
```
mvn clean install

```

## Next Steps
- Test OmniTable in high-load production scenarios.
- Explore alternative hash functions for insertion efficiency.
- Consider moving from `Unsafe` to `VarHandle` for better JVM support.

## Design Methodology and Evolution
OmniTable's performance and consistency were achieved through an iterative development process that combined several known techniques with new innovations:

1. **XXHash**  
   - Chosen for its fast and consistent hash distribution.  
   - Improved lookup consistency by minimizing clustering.  

2. **Robin Hood Hashing**  
   - Introduced to reduce probe distance and balance clusters.  
   - Helped maintain lookup speed under load but increased insertion cost due to probe shifting.  

3. **Hybrid Open Addressing + Robin Hood**  
   - Combined the benefits of open addressing and Robin Hood.  
   - Improved lookup consistency without significantly improving insertion speed.  

4. **Direct Bucket Injection (DBI)**  
   - A novel insertion strategy that injects keys directly into buckets without probe shifting.  
   - Reduced insertion cost while maintaining lookup and deletion speed.  
   - Robin Hood used as a fallback if clustering increases.  

5. **Adaptive Resizing + Memory Alignment**  
   - Adaptive resizing adjusted table size based on load factor.  
   - Memory alignment with CPU cache boundaries reduced cache misses and improved consistency.  

This unique combination of techniques gives OmniTable its consistent O(1) performance for insertion, lookup, and deletion — even in worst-case scenarios.
